        <h3>Directions</h3>
         <p>
          Preheat oven to 350°F. Place a round of parchment paper on bottom of a 9-inch springform pan, and grease it and sides 
          of pan with butter or cooking spray. Separate egg yolks and whites. Set whites aside and whisk yolks together with lemon zest and 1/4 cup of sugar.
          </p>

            src="../images/almond-cake-five.jfif"

           title="almond-cake-five"
           /> 
          <p>
           Whisk together almond flour, baking powder and salt in a separate bowl. Add flour mixture to egg mixture and 
           stir to combine thoroughly. (Mixture will be very thick).
          </p>
          <p>
          In a stand mixer fitted with a whisk attachment, beat egg whites on low speed, gradually increasing speed to medium. When whites 
          begin to froth and increase in volume, slowly add the remaining 1/4 cup of sugar. Increase speed to medium-high and beat until 
          soft peaks form, about 1 minute.
          </p>
        <img
            src="../images/almond-cake-six.jpg"

          <p>
     Stir a third of whipped egg whites into almond flour mixture until well combined. You can be more aggressive when stirring in this initial 
     addition of egg whites. Don’t worry about deflating the whites, they are meant to lighten and loosen the almond flour mixture. Fold remaining 
     whipped egg whites into almond flour mixture in 2 additions, ensuring egg whites are fully incorporated before adding the next batch. Pour batter 
     into pan; spread into an even layer with a small offset spatula using as few strokes as possible. Sprinkle almonds on top and bake until lightly 
     golden and top of cake springs back when touched, about 15 to 20 minutes. Remove from oven and let cool in pan on a wire rack for 10 minutes. Run
    a knife around edges of cake and then release cake from springform pan, discarding parchment paper. Transfer cake to a serving plate. Sprinkle 
    generously with powdered sugar and serve.
