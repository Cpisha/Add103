        <h2>Air Fryer Basque Cheesecake</h2>
        <div class="main-text">
          <p>
        Air fryers can be used to make everything from crispy coconut shrimp to fudgy brownies; here, we're using one to whip up a quick version of 
        a Basque cheesecake. Evenly browned with a creamy, silky, smooth center, this cheesecake boasts just the right amount of sweetness to contrast
         the bitter burnt top. Drizzling honey on top of the cake after baking adds an extra layer of warm sweetness, making this dessert feel that much more decadent.

        <h3>Directions</h3>
         <p>
           Preheat a large (6-quart or larger) air fryer to 375°F, if preheating is suggested by manufacturer. 
           Crumple a sheet (about 18 inches long) of parchment paper into a ball, then unroll; press sheet into
            a 6-inch springform pan or cake pan. Set aside.
          </p>
            <img
            src="../images/air-fryer-basque-cheesecake-five.JPG"
           alt="air-fryer-basque-cheesecake-five"
           id="air-fryer-basque-cheesecake-five"
           title="air-fryer-basque-cheesecake-five"
           /> 
          <p>
          While air fryer preheats, beat cream cheese, granulated sugar, and brown sugar with a stand mixer fitted with a 
          paddle attachment on low speed until completely smooth and sugar has dissolved, about 1 minute, stopping to scrape
           down sides as needed. Add eggs, 1 at a time, beating on low speed until just incorporated before adding next egg. 
           Stop and scrape down sides and bottom of bowl. Add whipping cream, lemon juice, salt, and vanilla to cream cheese 
           mixture; beat on low speed until just combined, about 15 seconds. Sprinkle flour over cream cheese mixture; beat on 
           low speed until just combined, about 20 seconds.
          <p>
         Place a fine mesh strainer over a medium or large bowl or liquid measuring cup. Working in batches, if needed, pour cheese 
         cream mixture through strainer, pressing and scraping bottom of strainer with a rubber spatula until most of the mixture has 
         strained through (some thicker bits may remain). Discard solids. Pour strained mixture into prepared cake pan.
          </p>

            src="../images/air-fryer-basque-cheesecake-six.jfif"
            alt="air-fryer-basque-cheesecake-six"
            id="air-fryer-basque-cheesecake-six"
            title="air-fryer-basque-cheesecake-six"
          />
          <p>
           Remove basket from preheated air fryer; using tongs, if desired, carefully lower cheesecake in pan into basket 
           (using 1 or 2 tongs helps to keep hands from getting close to hot basket). Return basket to air fryer; cook at 375°F for 28 minutes. 
           Remove basket from air fryer, and check to see if cheesecake center is still jiggly or the edges around top of cake appear wet. If so, 
           continue cooking at 375°F for 4 to 6 minutes. Cheesecake is done when the top is very dark brown, the entire cheesecake moves together 
           when jiggled, and the top of the cake slides around only slightly.
          </p>

          <p>Remove cheesecake in pan from air fryer basket; transfer to a wire rack, and let cool completely, about 1 hour. Transfer cheesecake 
            in pan to refrigerator; chill completely, at least 4 hours or up to 12 hours. Loosen sides of springform pan, and slide cheesecake out 
            from pan. Gently remove parchment paper from cake. Drizzle with honey, and serve. Cheesecake may be stored loosely covered or in an airtight 
            container in refrigerator up to 3 days.</p>
