        <h2>Chocolate Raspberry Icebox Cake</h2>
        <div class="main-text">
          <p>
         This Chocolate-Raspberry Icebox Cake is creamy, it's dreamy, and it's so simple to make. Crushed cookies, 
         fresh raspberries, and layers of tart raspberry sorbet and vanilla ice cream transform into a gorgeous marbled 
         layer cake in about 15 minutes â€” no frosting required. The raspberries sink into the milky, sweet layers of ice 
         cream, adding a tart flavor and pops of color to the cake, and crunchy chocolate cookie crumble layers are the perfect 
         sweet and salty counterpoint, adding satisfying texture and a hint of bittersweet flavor. Finally, after a deep chill in 
         the freezer, the cake is topped with whipped cream and more raspberries.

        <h3>Directions</h3>
         <p>
           Lightly coat a 9- x 5-inch loaf pan with cooking spray. Line with parchment paper, making sure all sides are fully 
           covered and leaving a 2-inch overhang on all sides.
          </p>

            src="../images/chocolate-raspberry-icebox-cake-five.jfif"
           alt="chocolate-raspberry-icebox-cake-five"
           id="chocolate-raspberry-icebox-cake-five"
           title="chocolate-raspberry-icebox-cake-five"
           /> 
          <p>
          Fold softened ice cream and sorbet together in a large bowl until sorbet is just 
          streaked through ice cream but not quite swirled, 2 to 3 folds.
          </p>
          <p>
          Sprinkle 1/2 cup crushed cookies into bottom of prepared loaf pan. Spread 1 1/2 cups ice cream mixture over crushed cookies. 
          Scatter 1/2 cup fresh raspberries over top, gently pressing into ice cream mixture. Repeat layers 3 times, 
          ending with remaining 1/2 cup crushed cookies.
        <img

            title="chocolate-raspberry-icebox-cake-six"
          />
          <p>
         Wrap loaf pan tightly with plastic wrap, and freeze until 
         cake is firm, at least 4 hours or up to 24 hours.
          
         <p>remove ice cream cake from freezer; unwrap and let stand at room temperature 5 minutes. Meanwhile,
           whisk together cream and powdered sugar in a medium bowl until stiff peaks form, about 2 minutes.</p>
           
          <p>Lift ice cream cake out of loaf pan using parchment paper overhang as handles, and invert onto a large plate or platter. 
            Dollop whipped cream over top of cake. Garnish with additional fresh raspberries. Slice and serve.</p>
