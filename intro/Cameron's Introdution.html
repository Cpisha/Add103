<h1>Cameron's Introduction</h1>
<p>I'm taking WEB 105 at McHenry County College. I am taking this course because I am interested 
    in a career in web design and development. I have always been interested in a career that involves 
    computers. I have tried to create websites with friends, but have not been very successful. 
    I believe this class will teach me the basic web design tools.</p>
<h2>Cameron's Hobbies</h2>
<h3>Cars</h3>

  <p>One of my favorite hobbies is driving cars and modifying cars. 
    I started driving go carts when I was about 4 years old and have been doing it since then. 
    When I turned 16, I bought my car. I got a 2020 Kia Forte GT. 
    I have modified it by adding a sub woofer, customized horn, and adding vinyls.</p>
<h3>Working out</h3>

    <p>My other hobby is working out. I love working out at the gym. My friend and I worked out almost every morning during the
    summer.
    We usually go about an hour and do both weight and cardio. Working out give me energy and make me feel great.</p>
<h3>Gaming</h3>
